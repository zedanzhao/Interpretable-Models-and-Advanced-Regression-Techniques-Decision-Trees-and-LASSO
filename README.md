# "Interpretable Models and Advanced Regression Techniques: Decision Trees and LASSO in Data Science
This project comprises two main parts:

Decision Trees as Interpretable Models: It involves downloading the Acute Inflammations dataset, building a decision tree, and converting its rules into IF-THEN statements. The project also includes using cost-complexity pruning to derive a minimal, interpretable decision tree.

The LASSO and Boosting for Regression: This part uses the Communities and Crime dataset, dealing with missing values and nonpredictive features, and analyzing feature correlations. It requires selecting features based on the Coefficient of Variation, creating visualizations, and fitting linear, ridge regression, LASSO, and PCR models to the data. The project concludes with fitting an L1-penalized gradient boosting tree using XGBoost, emphasizing regularization through cross-validation.

Both sections underscore practical applications of decision trees, regression models, and boosting in data science, emphasizing interpretability, feature selection, and error minimization.
